            <h2>Why Sardines Are a Sustainable Choice</h2>
            <p>Sardines are small, fast-growing fish that reproduce quickly, making them a highly sustainable option. Unlike larger fish, sardines are lower on the food chain, meaning they require fewer resources to thrive. This makes sardines an environmentally friendly seafood choice.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="fishing-practices">
            <h2>Eco-Friendly Fishing Practices</h2>
            <p>Our sardines are sourced using sustainable fishing practices that prioritize the health of the ocean and its ecosystems. By adhering to strict fishing quotas and using methods that minimize bycatch, we ensure that our sardines are harvested responsibly.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="health-benefits">
            <h2>Nutritional and Environmental Benefits</h2>
            <p>Sardines are packed with essential nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and calcium. Not only are they good for your health, but choosing sardines also supports a sustainable food system by reducing the pressure on overfished species.</p>
